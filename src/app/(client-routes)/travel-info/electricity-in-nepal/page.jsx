        <h1 className="title fw-bold">Electricity In Nepal</h1>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Electricity in Nepal, Residential electrical outlets in some countries
          including the United States use 110-120 volts of electricity, and
          accept very specific shaped plugs. Many other countries including
          Nepal use other voltages, 220-240 volts to power their appliances, as
          well different plugs. If you try to plug an American appliance such as
          a shaver or hairdryer into an outlet of a different voltage, you may
          destroy the appliance and cause yourself injury. There are few things
          you should know about other countries (here Nepal) before you travel.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Nepal’s Electricity is 220-240 Volts and 50 HZ (some countries like
          U.S and Canada are 110-120 volts/60 HZ). In Nepal electric Plugs are
          of two or three round prongs, but not flat prongs as found in use in
          the United States or in other countries.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          If your appliance’s plug doesn’t match the shape of these sockets, you
          will need a travel plug adapter in order to plug in. Travel plug
          adapters simply change the shape of your appliance’s plug to match
          whatever type of socket you need to plug into. If it’s crucial to be
          able to plug in no matter what, bring an adapter for both types.
        </p>

          If you are planning on taking a hair dryer, electric shaver, curling
          iron, laptop computer or other electrical devices on your travels, in
          these cases, you will need to obtain either a voltage adapter
          (electrical converter) or a plug adapter for your travels, most often
          both. Most voltage adapters for travel convert 220-240 to 110-120,
          usable by your American and similar appliance. A plug adapter, on the
          other hand, allows you to plug into a foreign outlet.In Nepal, you
          will need a voltage converter, and plug adapter in order to use U.S. –
          like appliances.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          In some countries you may only need one or the other (voltage
          converter or plug adapter), but in Nepal you may require both. Note:
          you may need many different plug adapters if your travels extend to
          more than one country, but one voltage adapter is okay to work in one
          country.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          We recommend getting a universal adapter and converter kit if you plan
          to take many electronics. It can be found in many hardware stores,
          travel shops and online retailers. Virtually all laptop computers and
          some electric razors take universal voltages. Check your equipment to
          be sure. If the only electric device that you plan to take with you is
          an electric shaver, you may consider buying a different model which
          accepts universal voltages, to avoid carrying around a heavy and bulky
          voltage adapter. Always be sure to check with the manufacturer of the
          appliance for proper use and conversion.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Electricity flow is not smooth in Nepal. Electricity often goes off
          and on. Voltage fluctuation is very common and it is advised that you
          use an adapter with quality power surge protector for your
          electronics.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Nepal has not been able to produce enough electricity to meet the high
          demand, so in dry seasons there is power outage (load shedding) for
          hours, however hotels and businesses cover their electrical needs via
          fuel cells and generators.
        </p>

          Note: You can find any of the transformers, plug adopter and
          converters to buy in Kathmandu and other major cities easily.
