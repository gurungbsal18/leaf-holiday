        <h1 className="title fw-bold">Best Kailash Season In Tibet</h1>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Deciding when to travel to Tibet is an important decision especially
          if you are travelling to Mt. Kailash. Actually there are no constant
          responses. Covering about one eighths of total Chinese territory,
          Tibet contains of seven major cities and regions. Discovering at
          dissimilar autonomy, each place has its own dissimilar climate and
          temperature. Thus, the best time to visit those places of attention
          also diverges.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The high elevation and atmosphere in Tibet consent the sunshine to
          assault the earth with rare concentration. To defend your eyes and
          skin, youâ€™d better bring a sunscreen with the lowest sun defense
          factor of 15; and sunglasses are also useful. Lip creams and balms
          with SPF grades, zinc, oxide creams provide ideal block-out.

          Usually speaking, the period from May to September is the best season
          for a tour in Tibet. However, a winter tour in Tibet could be
          comfortable as well, which depends on the route. In winter, Tibet has
          fewer tourists, so you can relish the stunning scenery spontaneously.
          And also May to September is best season to for a Kailash Yatra.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          Of the months from May to September, I recommend June, September as
          the finest months to go to Kailash. These months characteristically
          have clear climate permitting great views of the mountain. The summer
          months (July and August) at Kailash are drier than Lhasa and other
          areas of Central Tibet, however, thousands of Hindu travelers
          typically go to Kailash then. The trek around Kailash can be very busy
          in July and August, therefore I recommend evading those months.

          There are pros and cons to every season. You can make your choice on
          the basis of its suitability for you. Leaf Holidays Treks and
          Expedition is there in your service whatever the month or season.
