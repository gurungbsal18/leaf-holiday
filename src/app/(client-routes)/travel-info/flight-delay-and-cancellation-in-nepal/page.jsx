          Flight Delay and Cancellation In Nepal
        </h1>
        <p className="text-justify">
          The sole reason for the flight delays and cancellations in Nepal is
          the climatic variability in the difficult terrain. The adverse weather
          conditions like heavy rain, high winds and blinding fog results to the
          flight delays or even cancellation. Therefore, flights delay and
          cancellation are more likely in winter and rainy seasons. Tribhuwan
          International Airport lacks the Instrumental Landing System for the
          domestic flights due to which the flights in adverse weather
          conditions are cancelled considering the safety of the air passengers.

        <p className="text-justify">
          Generally, mid-January to end February is considered as the bad time
          for all the domestic air carriers in Nepal as there are flight delays
          more often and sometimes even the flights are cancelled. Even monsoon
          flights are not that guaranteed because sometimes heavy rain may lead
          to flight delay or even cancellation. But the flights take off and
          land in their exact time during the summer and spring seasons Flight
          delays and cancellation are very less likely. Flight delays and
          cancellation has caused more trouble in the field of tourism. Many
          tourists come to Nepal and get disheartened due to the flight delays
          and cancellation. It deteriorates their planned schedule. Flights to
          Pokhara, Chitwan and other touristic places can be opted by the road
          transport in case of flight cancellation but a flight to Lukla, the
          only gateway to the Everest can cause a huge problem. Lukla airport in
          itself is located in dramatic mountain location, therefore, taking off
          and landing the flights in cloudy or foggy weather can be too
          dangerous. Therefore, an extra day in Nepal is highly recommended to
          all the travellers in Nepal.
