        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          <strong>Autumn season (September to November):</strong> This season is
          the highly preferred and the most favorable period for trekking in
          Nepal. The weather is dry, stable and very clear. In this season; you
          will be showered with each and every beauty of Nepal. From the clear
          views of the splendid mountains, rivers, waterfalls to lush hills and
          forests, you can taste every aspect of Mother Nature in its best form
          in the moderate temperature condition.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          <strong>Winter season (December to February):</strong> Just in case,
          you are not afraid of cold, you can trek even through winter. The
          weather is dry and settled but cold. Trekking in high altitude is not
          recommended as it is very cold and snow covers almost everything. But,
          winter fall can be a good season for trekking in low elevation
          regions. You can see the clear views of the magnificent mountains and
          cherish the natural splendor of Nepal.

        <p className="text-justify">
          <strong>Spring season (March to May):</strong> Spring seasons is also
          the preferred season for hiking and is the best season for trekking in
          Nepal next to autumn. The temperature and snow line rise but the
          possibility of precipitation remains. The temperature is moderate and
          the environment is lush. The most amazing experience of trekking in
          this season is the flower blossoms. The whole environment becomes
          vivid and vibrant with colorful flowers. The colorful rhododendron
          forests will leave you speechless.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          <strong>Summer season (June to August):</strong> Summer season is
          generally not preferred for trekking in Nepal as the monsoon begins
          with warm and moist air from the Indian Ocean. The rain makes the
          roads slippery. Even the skies are not clear. It is cloudy and blue
          patches can be seen from the clouds. The rain, mud, slippery paths,
          leeches, and unclear mountain views make this fall not so good for
          trekking.
        </p>
        <p className="text-justify">
          There are pros and cons to every season. You can make your choice on
          the basis of its suitability for you. Leaf Holidays Treks and
